 # My foreign friends, we need your help! Russia has invaded Ukraine. It’s war and it’s real!

Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine - it's NOT a Ukrainian crisis.

Now the future of Europe and world security is at stake in Ukraine.

Ukraine defends not only its independence but also freedom, common values, democracy, and security of Europe.

The aim of the invasion is to eliminate Ukrainian statehood and to establish a regime loyal to Moscow.

This represents an act of war, a gross violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the UN Charter, and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.

Under article 51 of the UN Charter, Ukraine has activated its right to self-defense.

Russian troops invaded the territory of Ukraine from Russia, Belarus, and the occupied Crimea.

Russian air forces and artillery are shelling Ukrainian cities, military bases, and command centers, posing direct threats and casualties among civilians.

The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks by the Russian invasion troops.

These are the steps that the international community ought to do immediately in order to stop Russia:
Tell the truth — share verified information from Ukrainian official sources;
Impose devastating sanctions, including:
  - SWIFT ban
  - Fully isolate Russia by all means, in all formats
  - Provide Ukraine with weapons and military equipment
  - Provide Ukraine with financial assistance
  - Provide Ukraine with humanitarian assistance
